  Thanks for visiting my blog! I work for VMware and enjoy every minute of it. I like to write about my experiences with virtualization and other tech bacon. If you enjoy the content of this blog or the tools I publish, consider supporting me by ordering a _thatvirtualboy_ sticker (coming soon) or buying me a coffee. Thanks!
