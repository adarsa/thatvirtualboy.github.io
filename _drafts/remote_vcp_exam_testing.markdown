VMware now allows for remote testing of their Certified Professional exam. I just took the test from my home and here's what it was like.

Back in April, VMware Certification [announced](https://blogs.vmware.com/education/2020/04/16/remote-exam-testing-is-here/) remote proctoring of its exams promising the use of Artificial Intelligence in combination with LIVE monitoring. Using the latest technology in face-matching software, session monitoring and recording, browser lockdown and virtual ID verification, testing can now happen virtually anywhere.

> Can you really take these exams from anywhere?

Well, probably not. Some of the requirements in order to begin the exam are a working web cam and using that webcam to scan the room you're in (proving that the setting is a "secure and quiet" location), as well as show a form of ID. The Cyber Caf√© down the street probably wouldn't make the cut. But your home office or parent's basement will likely do the trick!
