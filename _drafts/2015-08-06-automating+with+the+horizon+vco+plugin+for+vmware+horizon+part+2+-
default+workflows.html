Welcome to Part 2 in a series of automating Horizon View tasks with the vCO Horizon plugin. In this post we'll connect the vCO plugin with our View Pod and run some workflows. If you're looking to install the plugin, this was covered in <a href="http://thatvirtualboy.com/2015/08/06/automating-with-the-horizon-vco-plugin-for-vmware-horizon-part-1-installation/">Part 1</a>.<br/><br/>Picking up where Part 1 left off, we need to configure the vCO connection to our View Pod. According to VMware pubs, we'll need to ensure the following prereqs are in place:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Ensure the vCO server can resolve the FQDN of the vCenter Server</li><br/>	<li>Ensure you have an administrator account that's a member of a vCO Admin Security Group in AD. This account will authenticate through vCenter SSO.</li><br/>	<li>Ensure you have View Admin credentials</li><br/></ul><br/><blockquote>Connect vCO Plugin to your View Pod</blockquote><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Login to the Orchestrator Client and click the blue Workflows Icon</li><br/>	<li>Navigate to <strong>Library</strong> &gt; <strong>Horizon</strong> &gt; <strong>Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>View Pod Configuration</strong></li><br/>	<li>Right-click <strong>Add View Pod in Configuration </strong>and choose <strong>Start Workflow</strong></li><br/>	<li>Fill out the appropriate fields.</li><br/>	<li>Verify the Workflow is green and is marked as completed</li><br/></ol>
