excerpt: "It's Friday! 🎉 Which means it's time for the Friday New Release Menu! 🍽 These posts document VMware's new and recent releases over the past two weeks. The Release Notes come highly recommended. Or if sampling is more your style, you can jump in with a VMware eval key (check with your TAM or account rep). Bon Appétit!"
