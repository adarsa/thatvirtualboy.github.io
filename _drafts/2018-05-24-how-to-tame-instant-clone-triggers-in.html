VMware vRealize Operations is smart, and only getting smarter - no one can refute that. However when it comes to vROPs for Horizon (V4H), some things require a bit more intervention to fine-tune the interactions between your Virtual Desktop Infrastructure and vROPs.<br /><br />For example, if using Instant Clone technology for your Horizon Desktops, you might find alerts in vROPs showing VM Disk IO Latency caused by snapshots on your CP-Parent-* VMs. In most situations, this is benign given the nature of the Instant Clone architecture.<br /><br />So how do we deal with these unnecessary messages in vRealize Operations? Enter Custom Object Groups. You can follow the official documentation <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/6.6/vrealize-operations-manager-66-config-guide.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />Creating a new object group<br /><br /><br /><br />
